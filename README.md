# Swill Programming Language
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Swill programming language project began early July, 2018, as a half-hearted attempt at language design. But now, it has become a serious project with bright prospects. At the moment, Swill is a very small objected oriented computer programming language. It has most basic language features to allow the creation of simple programs.
